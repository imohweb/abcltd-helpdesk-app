# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment Steps

1. Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root based on the `.env.abchelpdeskapp` file.
4. Run the following command to build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
   - MSSQL: Accessible on port 1433.

# Frontend - ABC Helpdesk App

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Usage

The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform the following actions:
- User authentication (login and registration).
- Ticket management (create, update, view, and comment on tickets).
- Admin actions (user management, performance metrics, and ticket export).
- Reports (view average times, ticket summaries, and top-performing agents).

## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project root and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Sample Data for Testing

Use the backend sample data to test the frontend functionality. Ensure the backend is running and the database is populated with sample data.

# CopilotAgentModePrompt to Deploy a Fictitious Helpdesk App for ABC Ltd

## Step 1: Initialize the project
- Create a new branch with the name "build-abchelpdesk-app" and create a full-stack web application project for a help desk system named "ABC-helpdesk-app" using Node.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend. Set up a monorepo structure with separate folders for backend and frontend.

## Step 2: Backend Initialization (Node.js)
In the backend folder, initialize a Node.js project using Express.js. Set up basic REST API routing, install `express`, `cors`, `dotenv`, `pg`, and `jsonwebtoken`. Add middleware for error handling and logging.

## Step 3: SQL Server Database Setup
Create a Microsoft SQL Server schema for the help desk app. Include tables for:
- users (id, name, email, password_hash, role)
- tickets (id, title, description, status, priority, customer_id, agent_id, created_at, updated_at)
- comments (id, ticket_id, user_id, message, created_at)
- ticket_status_history (id, ticket_id, status, changed_by_user_id, changed_at)
- Add drop statements at the top for in case there is an existing table
- Use SQL syntax and include foreign key constraints. Add the SQL file to the backend folder.

## Step 4: Database Connection
- Create a database utility module in Node.js to connect to the Microsoft SQL Server database using the mssql library and environment variables for DB credentials.

## Step 5: User Authentication
- Implement user registration and login endpoints with password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT-based authentication. Protect ticket routes using authentication middleware.

## Step 6: Ticket API Routes
Build RESTful API endpoints for:
- Creating a new ticket
- Updating a ticket (status, priority, assignment)
- Getting a list of all tickets with filters for status and priority
- Getting ticket details with comments
- Adding a comment to a ticket
- Use role-based access control to ensure only support agents or customers can perform specific actions.

## Step 7: Frontend Setup (React.js)
- In the frontend folder, create a new React app using Vite. Install Axios, React Router, and Tailwind CSS for UI styling. Configure routing for public and protected pages.

## Step 8: Frontend Pages and Components
Create the following React components/pages:
- Login and Registration page
- Customer Dashboard: Submit ticket, view own tickets
- Agent Dashboard: View all tickets, filter, assign, change status
- Ticket Details Page with comments
- Header and Sidebar navigation
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling and Axios to connect to backend API.

## Step 9: Authentication in React
- Implement login/logout functionality using JWT stored in local storage. Create an Axios instance that attaches the token to Authorization headers. Redirect users based on role after login.

## Step 10: Ticket Management UI
- Design the dashboard for agents to view, filter, and assign tickets. Display ticket metadata like title, status, priority, and time since creation. Add buttons for changing ticket status and adding comments inline.

## Step 11: Implement Admin Panel
Add an admin panel where only admins can:
- Create or deactivate users
- View performance metrics (e.g., number of tickets resolved by agent)
- Export tickets to CSV or Excel

## Step 12: Reporting and Analytics
Add backend endpoints and frontend UI to generate reports on:
- Average response and resolution time
- Number of tickets by status and priority
- Top performing agents
Use charts with Chart.js or Recharts in the React frontend.

## Step 13: Deploy the Application
- Add Dockerfiles for backend and frontend. Write a `docker-compose.yml` to bring up mssql, backend, and frontend. Add a `.env.example` for environment configuration. Document deployment steps in README.md.

## Step 14: Documentation
- Generate README.md files for both backend and frontend folders. Include setup steps, API documentation, and deployment instructions. Add sample data for testing.



# ABC Ltd Business Case for Developing a Helpdesk Application ( ABC Ltd is a Fictitious Organization)

## Problem Statement:
ABC Ltd is experiencing delays in responding to customer inquiries, complaints, and service requests due to a fragmented support system.
Currently, support requests are received via email, phone, and unstructured Excel sheets, making it hard to track, assign, and prioritize tasks effectively.

## Challenges:
- No centralized ticketing system to track customer issues
- Lack of visibility into ticket status, ownership, and response time
- Manual processes causing longer resolution times and customer dissatisfaction
- No analytics or performance metrics for support efficiency

## Proposed Solution:
Build a Help Desk Web Application to allow ABC Ltd to:
- Centralize customer support requests as tickets
- Automate ticket assignment and status updates
- Provide agents with a dashboard to manage workload
- Provide customers a portal to log issues and track progress
- Generate reports for SLAs, agent productivity, and issue trends

## Technology Stack:
- Backend: Node.js (Express.js)
- Frontend: React.js
- Database: MSSQL DB
- Infrastructure: Docker (optional for deployment)
- Authentication: JWT-based session or OAuth2
- Hosting: Cloud (e.g., Azure, Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render/Heroku for backend)

## Why GitHub Copilot Agent Mode:
- Accelerates application development with natural language instructions
- Increases productivity by autogenerating boilerplate code
- Reduces context switching between code, documentation, and tools
- Streamlines collaboration between developers and Copilot with focused, iterative prompts
- Encourages best practices by generating modern, structured codebases
