# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Deployment Steps

1. Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
3. Create a `.env` file in the project root based on the `.env.abchelpdeskapp` file.
4. Run the following command to build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

5. Access the application:
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
   - MSSQL: Accessible on port 1433.

# Frontend - ABC Helpdesk App

## Setup Instructions

1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## API Usage

The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform the following actions:
- User authentication (login and registration).
- Ticket management (create, update, view, and comment on tickets).
- Admin actions (user management, performance metrics, and ticket export).
- Reports (view average times, ticket summaries, and top-performing agents).

## Deployment Instructions

1. Ensure Docker and docker-compose are installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project root and run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
3. The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Sample Data for Testing

Use the backend sample data to test the frontend functionality. Ensure the backend is running and the database is populated with sample data.
